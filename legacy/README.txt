Old versions of the project that were abandoned.

Roblox:
    - Served as the foundation for Roblox Catalog API.
    - Abandoned, since building JDA without Gradle proved difficult and foolish.

Roblox Catalog API [ALPHA]:
    - Old version of the current RCA.
    - Works without the use of VPNs and Proxies.
    - Abandoned, as framework changed to work with Nord VPN's proxies.

Roblox Catalog API [BETA]:
    - Old version of Catalog Demon
    - Works with the use of TOR proxies
    - Abandoned as I've decided to go back to Proxies

Catalog Demon:
    - Best version of this project
    - Ability to expand seamlessly through proxies
    - Missing buy/sell functionality
